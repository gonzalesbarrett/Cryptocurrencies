# Cryptocurrencies

### Overview

This project is the weekly challenge for week 18 of the Data Science Bootcamp. It allows us to put into practice and showcase the skills learned in Module 18 of the bootcamp: Unsupervised Machine Learning.

### Purpose

Create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. The analysis includes cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.  To reduce overfitting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used.

### Results


### Summary

We provided the client with a list of cryptocurrencies being traded and classified them into 4 clusters.
